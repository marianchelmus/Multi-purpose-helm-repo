Create a helm chart which has:
- a deployment
- a service
- a service monitor

The deployment also needs to have a basic deployment of Redis with service

Requirements:
- Secrets needs to be imported from env vars - first import them using helm, then import them trough ArgoCD
- All variables needs to be configurable from values.yaml and should have default values
- All yaml must have documentation
- Deployment needs to have resource configs like limits / requests
- Ports needs to be configurable
- Focus on TCP socket testing
- Helm chart should be consumed by ArgoCD
- Use helm lint / megalinter
- Make it dynamically
- No hardcoded stuff
- All deployments and services should use labels

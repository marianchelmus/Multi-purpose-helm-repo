Create a helm chart which has:
- a deployment
- a service
- a service monitor

The deployment also needs to have a basic deployment of Redis with service

Requirements:
- Secrets needs to be imported from env vars - first import them using helm, then import them trough ArgoCD
- All variables needs to be configurable from values.yaml and should have default values
- All yaml must have documentation
- Deployment needs to have resource configs like limits / requests
- Ports needs to be configurable
- Focus on TCP socket testing
- Helm chart should be consumed by ArgoCD
- Use helm lint / megalinter
- Make it dynamically
- No hardcoded stuff
- All deployments and services should use labels


appVersion: "1.16.0" // tagged versoion for docker container 

- add secrets.yaml 
- add config file for pod limits 
- volume mount readOnly type | DONE
- volume mount subPath
- integrate secret environement to lookup env. variables 
- redis should contain a configmap 
- new service monitor to scrap metrics 
- metallb - check this out 
- tpl lookup for ports

- env variables should be taken from secret file env / tpl lookup and it should contain ifs 
- all deployments: if deployment is true - on all | default is true | DONE

- in backend service new port called metrics should be added and used by the metrics service to connect to the pod 



// {{environment}} - {{ aplicationName }} - hashul
// liveness probe si readiness probe -> test TCP socket (deployments) 
// initialDelaySecond & periodSecond
